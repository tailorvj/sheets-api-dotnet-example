* Fork this project
* Sign up for gitpod and open this project in a Gitpod workspace
* Login to Google Cloud Console
* Create a new project or use an existing one
* Add the Google Sheets API to your project
* Create a service account and make it an owner for Google Sheets
* Create a new key for your service account and download credentials.json
* copy credentials.json to the project root

* Your service account has an email address (client_email in credentials.json), add it as an editor to the Sheets document you would like to use
* Manually write some data to the spreadsheet for reading function (you don't have to)
* copy the spreadsheet id from the sheets doc URL. For example, in the following URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1anqSIemhu6dI_ixa8BdvpM1AOevviZH9LMoRzB6Xz14/edit#gid=0, the document id is 1anqSIemhu6dI_ixa8BdvpM1AOevviZH9LMoRzB6Xz14

* Manually edit these variables in Program.cs as needed: SheetName, NewData
* dotnet run - will log existing data to the console and append the new data
* Check your console for read data and the spreadsheet for new cells written from this script
* Modify the script as you wish
